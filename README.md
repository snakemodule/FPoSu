# FPoSu

This is a modification of McOsu that allows you to play in first person.

# Build

To make this I used the preconfigured Eclipse CDT project from the McEngine repo https://github.com/McKay42/McEngine (which I then imported the McOsu files to https://github.com/McKay42/McOsu). 

I have included my Eclipse project so in the best case scenario you'll be able to use that. See the McEngine repo for the instructions that I followed.
